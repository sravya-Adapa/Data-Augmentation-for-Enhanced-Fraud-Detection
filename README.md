# Data-Augmentation-for-Enhanced-Fraud-Detection
Contextual Data Augmentation for Enhanced Fraud Detection at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), I focused on improving the effectiveness of fraud detection systems using a variety of advanced techniques. I enhanced fraud detection by generating contextual transaction descriptions using the OpenAI API (GPT-4o-Mini), a Large Language Model (LLM). This approach provided a richer and more informative dataset, improving the system's ability to identify suspicious patterns in transactions. To ensure fairness in these descriptions, I utilized Falcon AI’s Text Summarization Model, specifically the Fine-Tuned T5 Small model, which helped neutralize any potential biases in the generated content, preventing the model from favoring any particular group or category.

Addressing the issue of class imbalance in fraud detection, I applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generated synthetic samples for underrepresented classes and enhanced the model’s ability to detect fraudulent transactions. Additionally, I employed TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization on the textual descriptions, which allowed the model to capture and analyze complex patterns within the transaction data. To optimize the model further, I applied L1 regularization to a Logistic Regression model, which aided in selecting the most relevant features while reducing overfitting. The resulting model achieved a precision of 98.53% and recall of 97.15%, showcasing its high effectiveness in identifying fraud and minimizing false positives. To validate its performance, I conducted rigorous cross-validation, which yielded a mean cross-validation score of 97.07%, demonstrating the model’s accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.
